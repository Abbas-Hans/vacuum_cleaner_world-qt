If you have QtCreator, just open the project and start coding.

If you want to use some other tool, you need to create Makefile:

  $ qmake-qt4 -o Makefile Agent.pro

and then use make to build the executable binary:

  $ make -j4 all

(here I tell make to use 4 threads - you can specify your number or ommit that
option)
